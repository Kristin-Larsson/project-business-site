# Business Site

My first project at Technigo bootcamp during the introdays. We worked in group with mob-programing and had only a few hours to create a business-site containing a header with a hero-image, radio-buttons, selector and a sumbit button.

## The problem

This was a challenge since it was the very first project in the bootcamp and all of us were new to coding.

## View it live
Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.
